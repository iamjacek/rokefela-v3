          Copyright and Trademark Infringement Policy and Notification
          Procedure: BeatStars Inc. (“BeatStars”) does not own the
          musical compositions, sound recordings, art or other written
          or visual images (collectively, the "Content") posted by us
          to the Website. All Content is posted by us and we have
          represented and warranted to BeatStars that, among other
          things, neither the Content nor the names, trademarks and
          service marks under which Content is promoted (collectively,
          the "Name") infringes any third party's copyright, patent,
          trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights
          of publicity or privacy, or moral rights (see the section
          titled 'Representations and Warranties' of the current
          BeatStars Terms of Service here. Buyers are subject to clear
          any samples on any composition purchased.

          Since BeatStars is not in a position to determine who has
          the prevailing claim to use any particular Content or Name
          posted to the Website, its policy on such matters is that
          they be resolved directly by the parties alleging misuse of
          their Content and/or Name (the "Complainants'') and us.
          Immediately notify us about allegations of infringement by
          clicking the Contact link and contacting us directly.
        </p>
        <p className="py-1 font-sans text-base tracking-wide text-white">
          Complainants may notify us concerning any Content and/or
          Name being used on the Website in violation of their rights
          by sending an email to rokefelamusic@gmail.com. We shall use
          information provided by Complainants in accordance with our
          then-current Privacy Policy and as reasonably necessary to
          address any allegations contained therein. In most cases,
          soon after receiving written notice alleging infringement,
          we will either remove the allegedly infringing Content
          and/or Name from those web pages identified or, at our
          election, remove those web pages entirely.

          Refund policy: We do not offer refunds. If there are any
          issues with a premium service or an ordered item please

          any issue amicably. Premium services (recurring billings)
          can be canceled anytime for any reason. Cancellations by the
          individual, group or company that signed up for the premium
          service (collectively, the "Subscriber") will be effective
          after the paid period. In case of cancellation by the
          Subscriber the period that is already paid for will not be
          reimbursed. The premium service will then remain active
          until the end of the paid period. We reserve the right to
          cancel premium services for any reason at any time without
          notification. If we cancel a premium service before its
          expiration date, the Subscriber might be entitled to a
          pro-rated refund of the last payment. No refund will be
          given if a user violates the Terms and Conditions of the
          Website or any relevant License Agreement.
